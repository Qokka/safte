# SAFTE: flexible fundraising agreement for both token sale and equity financing

I created a special fundraising agreement to accommodate both traditional investors who prefer equity financing (e.g. including equity pre-sale, such as YC’s SAFE), and progressive crypto investors who may prefer token sales / ICOs. The result enables investors to take advantage of not only the liquidity offered by ICO / token sales (if the company offers one in the future), but also the benefit of equity appreciation and legal protection in traditional equity financing. I asked an attorney to review and revise this agreement, and I have raised money from multiple investors based on this agreement.

I have made this agreement public on Github, and I hope this could help other startups and investors in the crypto space. I summarized the highlights of my document in my blog (Medium, and Steemit), and compared this agaisnt YC's SAFE, Protocol.ai’s SAFT, and Colony.io’s SAFTE. In my blogs, I also explained the benefits of this agreement, why I did this. Please find more details in my blogs.

I hope this helps, but if you decide to use this document, please also consult with your own lawyers. I do not assume any responsibility or consequence for using this document.
